  abstract = {Several defenses have increased the cost of traditional, low-level attacks that corrupt control data,
                  e.g. return addresses saved on the stack, to compromise program execution.  In response, creative
                  adversaries have begun circumventing these defenses by exploiting programming errors to manipulate
                  pointers to virtual tables, or vtables, of C++ objects. These attacks can hijack program control flow
                  whenever a virtual method of a corrupted object is called, potentially allowing the attacker to gain
                  complete control of the underlying system.  In this paper we present SafeDispatch, a novel defense to
                  prevent such vtable hijacking by statically analyzing C++ programs and inserting sufficient runtime
                  checks to ensure that control flow at virtual method call sites cannot be arbitrarily influenced by an
                  attacker.  We implemented SafeDispatch as a Clang++/LLVM extension, used our enhanced compiler to
                  build a vtable-safe version of the Google Chromium browser, and measured the performance overhead of
                  our approach on popular browser benchmark suites.  By carefully crafting a handful of optimizations,
                  we were able to reduce average runtime overhead to just 2.1\%.}
